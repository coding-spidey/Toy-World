                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Imagination</h3>
                <p class="text-center">Free play is how children develop their imagination – the foundation for
                    creativity. Curiosity asks WHY and imagines possible explanations. Playfulness asks WHAT IF and
                    imagines how the ordinary becomes extraordinary, fantasy or fiction. Dreaming it is a first step
                    towards doing it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3 grid-2">
                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Creativity</h3>
                <p class="text-center">Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising and
                    valuable - and it’s an essential 21st century skill. Systematic creativity is a particular form of
                    creativity that combines logic and reasoning with playfulness and imagination.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3 grid-3">
                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Fun</h3>
                <p class="text-center">Fun is being active together, the thrill of an adventure, the joyful enthusiasm
                    of children and the delight in surprising both yourself and others in what you can do or create. Fun
                    is the happiness we experience when we are fully engaged in something that requires mastery, when
                    our abilities are in balance with the challenge at hand and we are making progress towards a goal.

                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Learning</h3>
                <p class="text-center">Learning is about being curious, experimenting and collaborating – expanding our
                    thinking and doing, helping us develop new insights and new skills. We learn through play by putting
                    things together, taking them apart and putting them together in different ways. Building,
                    un-building, rebuilding, thereby creating new things and developing new ways of thinking about
                    ourselves, and the world.</p>

            <div class="grid-5">
                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Caring</h3>
                <p class="text-center">Caring is about our desire to make a positive difference in the lives of
                    children, for our colleagues, our partners, and the world we live in. Doing that little extra, not
                    because we have to – but because it feels right and because we care.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-6">
                <h3 class="text-center text-red">Quality</h3>
                <p class="text-center">For us quality means the challenge of continuous improvement to provide the best
                    play material, the best for children and their development and the best to our community and
                    partners. From a reputation for manufacturing excellence to becoming trusted by all – we believe in
                    quality that speaks for itself and earns us the recommendation of all.</p>
